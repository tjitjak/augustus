# Project Augustus

An experiment when writing articles with lots of data, references and tables. 
Correcting data should be possible.

# About

_'Herdenking slachtoffers van na Augustus 1945'_

"For the - first generation - Dutch Indo Europeans, in addition to the Japanese occupation, the period August 1945 - 1950 is also a timeframe in which once again victims fell who should not be forgotten."

_The plan is to make additional documents with the number of victims before and after August 1945._
