# Project Augustus

An experiment when writing an article with lots of references used to make tables.
Also correcting data should be possible.

## _'Herdenking slachtoffers van na Augustus 1945'_

"For the - first generation - Dutch Indonesians, in addition to the Japanese occupation, the period August 1945 - 1950 is also a period with once again victims who should not be forgotten."

_The plan is to make additional documents with the number of victims before and after August 1945._
