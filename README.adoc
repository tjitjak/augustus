# About

"_Commemoration of victims after August 1945_"

"For the - first generation - Dutch Indo-Europeans, in addition to the Japanese occupation, the period August 1945 - 1950 is a timeframe in which once again victims fell who should not be forgotten."

_The plan is to make additional documents with the number of victims before and after August 1945._
